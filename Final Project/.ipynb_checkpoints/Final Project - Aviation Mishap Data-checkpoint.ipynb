    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Over the relatively short 118 year history of powered human flight, the human race has achieved the unachievable time and again. From the first slow short hops of the Wright brothers in 1903 to supersonic jet flight only 44 years later, and to the moon only 22 years after that, untold numbers of people have perished in the advancement of aviation technology. These days, we think almost nothing of boarding a machine that can fly us at altitudes approaching 40,000 feet at almost the speed of sound to get us from one side of the country to the other in mere hours. While the technology is proven and safe enough for us to not worry about the miniscule chance of a serious problem resulting in a devastating outcome, those problems do still arise. There are many causes for aviation mishaps and accidents, and whenever one occurs, investigators gather every possible data point that could lead to a better understanding of what happened and how to prevent it in the future.\n"

This system provides links to multiple source databases provided from the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), among others, that track various safety issues and incident and accident reports."

    "Are there significant groupings of primary and secondary contributing factors in aviation mishaps when looking at different types of mishaps? For example, do stall or spin mishap types occur more frequently when there is a specific combination of contributing factors (e.g., pilot-based features, aircraft-based features, weather-based features)?\n",

    "## Project Execution\n",
    "This project required me to look at many different data sets from the NTSB, FAA, BTS, and NASA. I selected a dataset from the FAA's Accident/Incident Database (AIDS). This database is very thorough and spans many years (pre-1975, then each year through 2015). I began by looking at the data download site at http://av-info.faa.gov/dd_sublevel.asp?Folder=%5CAID.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is broken down by year groups, with one text file (tab delimited) per 5 year time period. The resulting data set is massive. I began by choosing the most recent year group (2015 - 2019) which includes incidents up to July 29th, 2017. Upon further analysis (~3 hours) of this file, I determined that many data fields I was interested in were missing, most likely due to recent changes in how the data is reported and stored in this database. I then looked back and a previous date range (2005-2009) and selected that file for further analysis. This file contains 15,782 rows and 180 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered combining all data files into one DataFrame for analysis, but for the scope of this project, I chose to keep my analysis to a single file with incidents from 2005-2009. In the future, it would be interesting to conduct the same analysis on the combined data set to look at the trends of accidents and incidents over time."

    "# Data Familiarization and Munging Phase\n",
    "### Getting Familiar With the Data\n",
    "In this phase I examined basic information about the data set. After I pulled the data into my notebook, I found that I did not need most of the 180 columns. I imported the data dictionary from a text file into a spreadsheet (./data/Data Dictionary.xlsx) and looked at the columns to determine those I could drop for the main data set. I annotated the spreadsheet with my keep/drop decisions by coloring the features I wished to keep as green, and those to drop as red. I also categorized the features by pilot-related characteristics, aircraft-related characteristics, and added other notes. Finally, I added a column to the dictionary to sort it. This was necessary because I noticed that related features were not located next to each other in the downloaded data set. For example, the Primary Cause Factor text (c77) and Primary Cause Factor Code (c78) were stored as columns 146 and 122, respectively. Sorting the data dictionary allowed me to easily identify these related columns and extract only the features I wanted to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the selection process I looked at value_counts() for each feature and compared the results to the Data Dictionary to get a feel for the data contained within and to further inform the features I would keep or drop. Based on sorting and analyzing value_counts, I realized that there were multiple columns that represented the same data. For example, several date and time fields were represented as both separate year, month, day, time columns and again as a combined column. Also, many of the columns are encoded (key is found in './data/AIDCODES.doc') with the same data recorded in plain text in another column. In these cases, I chose to keep the plain text and drop the encoded column.\n",
    "### Munging\n",
    "Once I completed my initial look at the data and the data dictionary, I went through the following steps to make it more manageable:\n",
    "1. I dropped the columns I determined I would not need for this analysis.\n",
    "2. I renamed the remaining columns to plain-language names\n",
    "3. I dropped all rows that did not have any primary causal factors listed.\n",
    "4. I dropped rows with no accident type listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of the questions I wanted to examine would need some features while others would not, I kept the 'faa' dataset as whole as possible, and peeled off subsets of the data into separate dataframes as needed for my analysis."
